Hi Subham

Kartik here

I have encountered a few questions in the assignment
1. There is no mention of any database, so I am going with Mongodb, is it fine?
2. There are models defined for both user and subtask but there is no defined model for Task model in the document, so do I have to define it in my own way?
And also there is no mention of login and registration of the new user, may you please let me know, do I have to first create user
if yes, then where do I have to use jwt for Task - {title, description, duedate} or for user session





1. I am using trigger on pre save and pre update but still on soft delete where I am updating, the trigger is not working
